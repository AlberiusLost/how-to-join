# Welcome!
This is a super quick readme file to quickly explain the process of becoming a Contributor and eventually a Developer for the Dragalia Lost Continuation project.

# How to become a Contributor
Most of this project is open-source! However it should be noted that you do need to have your own copy of an APK or IPA of the last version before shutdown/file removal. We don't know this version yet, so this will just be the latest version. If you do not have your own files, you will need to follow a tutorial (which would be linked here if it was available) to download your own copy. Sharing or asking for these files is at your discretion and at your own risk.

After getting these files, you'd need to make multiple meaningful contributions to the program. This would either be through providing scripts, tutorials, documentation, or the main project serer itself. 

Contributors are given access to edit the Trello board as well as a special role and channel on the Discord server. We deeply thank anyone who chooses to contribute!

# How to become a Developer
Developers are more hands-on with the project itself, and are usually the ones at the forefront of new features. While contributors are able to make new features, developers are usually given more freedoms to work on the project. Due to this freedom, gaining the developer role and a spot on the GitHub Organization requires contributors to go through a private screening process.

This requires an application and an interview to ensure that you aren't a bad actor before placing you on the team. You also need to be relatively around, active, and known around the community to verify that trust.

# That's all, thank you!
